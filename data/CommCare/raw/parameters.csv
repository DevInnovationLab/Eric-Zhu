unit_cost_pre2021,"Unit cost per FLW (India), before 2021",210.560,Correspondence; Dimagi's Total Cost of Ownership model (which uses India as an example),"Before 2021: $329/FLW per Dimagi's Total Cost of Ownership model from 2019, based on ICDS-CAS costs, where large share of cost comes from phone procurement. Per email discussion with Dimagi, FLWs also personally benefit from using the procured phones (approx 28% personal usage). As a result, we subtract the 28%, and take half of that for a conservative estimation up until 2021 (1-0.72*0.5)"
unit_cost_2021onward,"Unit cost per FLW (India), 2021 onward",100.000,Correspondence; Dimagi's Total Cost of Ownership model (which uses India as an example),After 2021: We do not have data on cost per FLW under the Indian government led program. We know from a phone call with BMGF India digital health team that the costs have drastically reduced (possibly to $10-$15/FLW). Our best guess of Poshan Tracker's at scale cost is $100/FLW (conservative compared to $10-15/FLW per BMGF)
