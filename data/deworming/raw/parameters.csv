present_value,Present value of lifetime benefits from a year of deworming — in terms of increases in ln(consumption) — DtW,0.115,GiveWell's CEA v4,"GiveWell assumes a value of 0.21, which includes an adjustment for benefits decaying over time and a household multiplier. To be conservative, we use 0.115, before these 2 adjustments, taking roughly half the impact on consumption. We assumed 4% discounting of consumption. 

Some kids reached through NDD from age 1-19 will be the same YoY, so this calculation assumes a linear dose-response relationship. This might be too strong and we may modify this later after further review. We may take a similar approach to GiveWell's CEA adjusting for a 10% decay over time in the impact."
takeup,Take up adjustment,0.9125,GiveWell India Coverage analysis,"GiveWell analyzed coverage figures and found that Government reported deworming coverage represents about 80% of all eligible children; and when audited the number of students dewormed was actually roughly about 73% coverage of all eligible children. Because of this, we adjust government reported figures by 0.73/0.8=0.9125."
unit_cost,Unit cost per child per year (India),0.35, GiveWell's DtW cost calcuations (India),We use an estimate of the unit cost per year (both rounds) in India in 2020. This may be revised later as we get better information.
